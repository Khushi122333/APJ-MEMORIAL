        <p>
            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the "Missile Man of India," 
            was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He hailed from a 
            humble background but went on to become one of the most respected leaders 
            and scientists of India.

            He was instrumental in developing India's first satellite launch vehicle
             (SLV-III) and various missile systems, including Agni and Prithvi. His 
             contributions to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the

            He was also a prolific writer and motivational speaker, with books like

             people worldwide.

            Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the
